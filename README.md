Just a polybar theme made for experimenting with ricing Linux

# Guide
1. Install the polybar (yay -S polybar on Arch)
2. Paste/Clone the "confidence" folder into /home/NAME/.config/polybar/
3. The scripts folder with its contents are from https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify if you need a more up-to-date version of those.
4. Run it :D

I'm completely a total noob in committing a repo here, so feel free to correct me for any mistakes.
